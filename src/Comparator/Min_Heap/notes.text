🔑 One simple rule to remember:-
# Who should come first → make that “smaller” in comparator.*
    1.Want greater marks first → use b.marks - a.marks
    2.Want smaller marks first → use a.marks - b.marks
    3.Want greater roll first → use b.roll - a.roll
    4.Want smaller roll first → use a.roll - b.roll
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#This is the core rule of comparator / compareTo.
    Memorize this — everything depends on it.
    When Java calls:
    compare(a, b)

    Your function returns a number.

    Java reads that number like this:
    Returned value	Meaning in Java
    < 0	a is smaller → a comes out first
    > 0	b is smaller → b comes out first
    = 0	both are equal priority

    *Example
    return a.marks - b.marks;
    If:
    a.marks = 80
    b.marks = 90


    Calculation:-
    80 - 90 = -10  (< 0)

    Java thinks:-
    a is smaller → a comes out first

    *Reverse example
    return b.marks - a.marks;
    If:
    a.marks = 80
    b.marks = 90


    Calculation:
    90 - 80 = +10  (> 0)

    Java thinks:
    b is smaller → b comes out first

    Final Simple Rule
    < 0 → first argument wins
    > 0 → second argument wins
    = 0 → tie, any order
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    PriorityQueue always removes the one that is considered smaller by this rule.
    Yes — that statement is always true, for every PriorityQueue in Java.

    PriorityQueue always removes the element that is considered smaller by the comparison rule.

    This is valid for:

    Natural ordering (Comparable)
    Custom ordering (Comparator)

    Min-heap
    Max-heap
    Any object type

    Why It Works for Both (Min and Max)
    Case 1: Min-Heap
    You define : return a - b;
    Smaller number = “smaller” → comes out first
    So: 1, 3, 5  → 1 comes out first

    Case 2: Max-Heap
    You define: return b - a;
    Now you are saying:
    Bigger value is “smaller” in comparison
    So:1, 3, 5 → 5 comes out first


    Java still removes the “smaller” one —
    but you changed the meaning of “smaller.”

    So the rule never changes

    Java always does:

    remove element that compare(...) says is smaller


    What changes is:

    Your comparator

    Your definition of “smaller”

    One-Line Final Truth

    PriorityQueue behavior never changes.
    Your comparator decides what “smaller” means.
